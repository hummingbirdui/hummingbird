Hummingbird is an extensive, open-source library of UI components built as the most sensible UI library for Tailwind CSS. It is designed to provide a definitive toolset for rapid development, featuring a massive collection of variants, plug-and-play integration, and a performance-first architecture.
The library includes all essential components required for modern web development, such as buttons, forms, and modals, alongside complex layouts and a clean codebase designed for data-rich dashboards, SaaS applications, and e-commerce platforms.

All elements are meticulously crafted with Tailwind CSS utility classes and are designed to be fully extensible. The library is framework-agnostic, with guides and wrappers to ensure seamless integration into any modern development stack.

## Getting started

Hummingbird is a fast, lightweight UI library built on top of Tailwind CSS utility classes. Write cleaner HTML, customize with utilities, and bring your project to life with interactive, accessible components. Start building today by following the quickstart guide.

## Installation

#### 1. Install Tailwind CSS

Ensure you have a project set up with Tailwind CSS. If you haven't set up Tailwind CSS yet, follow the <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official installation guide</a>.

#### 2. Install Hummingbird

Install Hummingbird via your preferred package manager:

<Example lang='bash' showPreview={false} code={`npm install @hummingbirdui/hummingbird`} />

#### 3. Import CSS

Import Hummingbird styles in your main CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`).

<Example lang='css' showPreview={false} 
  code={`@import "tailwindcss";
  @import "@hummingbirdui/hummingbird";`} />

#### 4. Initialize JS plugins

Include Hummingbird javascript at the end of your HTML body.

<Example lang='html' showPreview={false} 
  code={`<script src="../path/to/@hummingbirdui/hummingbird/dist/hummingbird.bundle.min.js"></script>`} />

Alternatively, when using a build system (e.g., Vite or Webpack), you can include Hummingbird by importing it in your JavaScript entry file.

<Example lang='js' showPreview={false} 
  code={`import '@hummingbirdui/hummingbird';`} />

**Optimization:** To reduce the final bundle size, you can import only the specific JavaScript plugins you need. Follow the [optimization](./javascript#optimization) approach in the JavaScript section.

Learn more about Hummingbird's JavaScript components in the [JavaScript section](./javascript).


### JavaScript API

Hummingbird also provides a JavaScript API for programmatic control of components. For example, you can toggle an `modal` manually using the API.

Here’s how to initialize and use the [Modal](/docs/components/modal) component:

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary" data-open-demo-modal>Open</button>
<div class="modal">...</div>
```
<br/>

```js
import { Modal } from "@hummingbirdui/hummingbird";
const openBtn = document.querySelector("[data-open-demo-modal]");
const myModal = new Modal(".modal");

openBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  myModal.show();
});
```

### TypeScript Support

Hummingbird includes TypeScript definitions for all components. If you're using TypeScript, you can import Hummingbird plugins with their types.

```ts
import { Modal } from "@hummingbirdui/hummingbird";
import { type ModalClass, type ModalInstance, type ModalOptions } from "@hummingbirdui/hummingbird";
```

### ESM vs CJS

Hummingbird supports both **ESM** and **CJS** builds so it works with different environments:

* **ESM**
  Used by modern bundlers like **Vite**, **Rollup**, and **Webpack 5+**. If your project is using ES modules (`import` syntax), this is what gets loaded automatically.

* **CJS**
  Used in **Node.js** or older tooling that relies on `require()`. If your environment doesn’t support ESM, bundlers and Node will fall back to this file.

You don’t need to choose manually, your bundler or runtime will pick the right version based on your setup.
