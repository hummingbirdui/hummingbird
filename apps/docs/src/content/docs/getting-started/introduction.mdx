## What is Hummingbird?

Hummingbird is a Tailwind framework with a large set of UI components created to provide a structured and reusable component system for Tailwind CSS. It offers a broad set of components and variants intended to support efficient development. The library includes common interface elements such as buttons, forms, and modals, as well as layout patterns suitable for dashboards, SaaS applications, and e-commerce systems.

All components are built with Tailwind CSS utility classes and are designed to be extensible. Hummingbird is framework-agnostic and includes guidance and wrappers to enable integration with various modern development environments.
